# JobsDataDashboard-jddgrabber
Jobs Data Dashboard Project - jddgrabber component

My personal project to create a system with various technologies, just for knowledge.
A jobs data system to grab data from several sources, compile them and shows it in a dashboard.

This component is responsible to grab data from public jobs APIs and save it to a database.

The documentation can be found in repository JobsDataDashboard-doc.

Note: to run pytest, it's necessary to put the path to the "src" dir in PYTHONPATH environment variable first.
