# JobSeekerProject
My personal project to create a system with various technologies, just for knowledge.
A job seeker system to grab data from several sources, compile them and shows it in graphical ways.

Note: to run pytest, it's necessary to put the path to the "src" dir in PYTHONPATH environment variable first.
